Wait, don&#8217;t even think about packing your bags soon if you don&#8217;t get a ticket!<\/p>\n<p>Let me unveil a secret. If you are going to be a full stack ninja, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.javascript.com\/\">JavaScript<\/a> is the exactly essential ticket that you need. Even if you don&#8217;t have any plan on doing any web development, you will most certainly bump into JavaScript at some points on your journey. <\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re unconvinced that you need to <strong>get familiar with JavaScript<\/strong>, I suggest that you should read my whole below reasons.<\/p>\n<h3>First easy step for beginner<\/h3>\n<p>How grateful it is to learn new thing but it&#8217;s easy to catch up on! Believe it or not, of <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/2016\/08\/12\/what-is-the-best-programming-language-for-beginners\/\">the hundreds of programming languages<\/a> that you could learn, none are <strong>as simple to learn as JavaScript is<\/strong>. It&#8217;s higher level language, which means it takes away most of complex details of the machine so your job is just focus on learning how to program. <\/p>\n<h3>Having fun together<\/h3>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/reason-to-learn-JavaScript3.jpg\" alt=\"Reasons why every programmer need to learn JavaScript\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1048\" \/><\/p>\n<p>JavaScript is <strong>a must learn for front-end developers<\/strong>. Pages without JavaScript are rather bland, whereas JavaScript laced sites allow for animation and better control over the web interface. It&#8217;s dynamic and flexible to use on object-oriented programming.<\/p>\n<h3>In demand<\/h3>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/reason-to-learn-JavaScript4.jpg\" alt=\"Reasons why every programmer need to learn JavaScript\" width=\"800\" height=\"762\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1049\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The rapidly increasing of online business makes JavaScript skills in demand for those who want to become professional programmers. Doubt it? To see it in action, open any job hunting websites, then you will see there are thousands of job announcements for programmer and software developer requiring either JavaScript directly or some JavaScript libraries such as <a href=\"https:\/\/nodejs.org\/en\/\">Node.js<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/angularjs.org\/\">Angular.js<\/a>, etc.<\/p>\n<h3>One language to rule them all<\/h3>\n<p>JavaScript is super versatile. Just like a dynamic kid, it runs everywhere from desktop and mobile apps, servers, databases, to even physical hardware. Especially, JavaScript is <strong>the only language built for both client-side and server-side<\/strong>, which makes it very fast because any code functions can be run immediately instead of having to contact the server and wait for the answer.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/reason-to-learn-JavaScript1.jpg\" alt=\"Reasons why every programmer need to learn JavaScript\" width=\"800\" height=\"458\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1050\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Besides, do you ever dream of the perspective of universal code &#8211; <strong>write once, then run everywhere<\/strong>? I know you do! Who doesn&#8217;t? JavaScript makes this case realizable. Once you learn JavaScript, you can use everywhere. Isn\u2019t it amazing! <\/p>\n<h3>Great learning resources<\/h3>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/reason-to-learn-JavaScript5.jpg\" alt=\"Reasons why every programmer need to learn JavaScript\" width=\"800\" height=\"451\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1053\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Depending on your learning style, there are enormous amount of JavaScript resources out there for you to choose. A growing number of online JavaScript tutorials and classes have emerged in recent years. I highly recommend you to try <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codecademy.com\/\">Codecademy<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codeschool.com\/\">Code School<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3schools.com\/\">W3school.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Because you&#8217;ll have to anyway<\/h3>\n<p>In an environment, where the technologies and internet develop as lightning speed, website will become the future of any kinds of business. Speaking of the web, we can avoid mentioning the browsers and the browsers mean running the JavaScript. That&#8217;s why in the eyes of many experts, JavaScript is quickly becoming one of the world most popular and powerful programming language. We absolutely sure that there will be no job positions for programmers that would not have anything with JavaScript to do. <\/p>\n<p>So, one way or another, you still have to learn it anyway. Why don&#8217;t you learn it now, then you will be the master in future!<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, JavaScript is not the only language you should ever learn, but it&#8217;s the only language that you HAVE TO learn if you want to dominate the web world. Again, no other language can take you as far if you want to do is create web application. <\/p>\n<p>Now, your turn! Do you agree with my ideas? What do you think about learning JavaScript?

A great resume can open many different doors for your career, but an inferior one can just as quickly close one. In fact, there are many people who inadvertently put themselves in a disadvantage, simply because of the information they choose to include on their resume. <\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not that the information is bad. It&#8217;s just not needed. You know, the hiring manager spend their whole day receiving and reading CVs. Who has enough time for spending 30 minutes on each one? If your resume is too long, it will discourage them and chances are they won&#8217;t read it until the end.<\/p>\n<p>With this in mind, the following list is items should not be in your resume, otherwise it will make your resume clutter:<\/p>\n<h3>The word &#8220;Resume&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/resume-mistakes1.jpg\" alt=\"Things you should never put on your resume\" width=\"800\" height=\"646\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1023\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Looking at your resume, who wouldn&#8217;t know what kind of document it is? No need to waste your paper to label your resume &#8220;resume&#8221;. One more thing adding, remember to <strong>name your resume by your own name<\/strong> so the recruiter will recognize whose resume is in seconds. <\/p>\n<h3>Objective Statement<\/h3>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/resume-mistakes2.jpg\" alt=\"Things you should never put on your resume\" width=\"800\" height=\"453\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1024\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you applied, it&#8217;s already obviously you want the job. It&#8217;s wiser to <strong>leave an objective off your resume or use a profile<\/strong> than use objective statement which doesn&#8217;t correspond well with the focus of the target job. <\/p>\n<h3>Private Information<\/h3>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/resume-mistakes3-1.jpg\" alt=\"resume-mistakes3\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1026\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There is no need to include any private information beyond your email, adress, phone number such as your marital status, religious preference, etc. I also recommend removing your hobbies from resume. Who cares about it? Unless your hobbies are actually related to the that job, you are merely wasting your resume estate. <\/p>\n<h3>Personal Picture<\/h3>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/resume-mistakes4.jpg\" alt=\"Things you should never put on your resume\" width=\"1000\" height=\"828\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1027\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Believe it or not, people still judge a book by its cover, if you don&#8217;t want to lose your chance to your dreaming jobs simply because of your appearance, then it&#8217;s time to remove the picture of you. More than that, submitting your personal picture on a resume is considered unprofessional. An exception should be if you were applying for a modeling or active job, where appearances inform hiring decision. <\/p>\n<h3>Irrelevant job experience<\/h3>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/resume-mistakes5.jpg\" alt=\"Things you should never put on your resume\" width=\"800\" height=\"487\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1028\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The fact that the recruiters don&#8217;t want to know about that summer you worked as a waitress if you are applying for accounting job. Additionally, your resume has to go beyond saying which job you have done: It&#8217;s a must to tell the recruiter what you&#8217;ve achieved from those jobs.<\/p>\n<h3>An unprofessional email<\/h3>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/resume-mistakes6.jpg\" alt=\"Things you should never put on your resume\" width=\"800\" height=\"594\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1030\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you still use an old email address, like badboy123@yahoo.com, lovelygirl@gmail.com, it&#8217;s time to pick a new one. It&#8217;s too easy to get a generic, free email account from Gmail or Yahoo for your interview correspondence ro represent yourself in such professional manner.<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>We&#8217;re always struggling with tons of problems when creating a professional resume that impresses our potential employer, right? To take away all that mess, I highly recommend you to use the app named <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=br.com.curriculum\">Curriculum Manager<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Curriculum Manager<\/strong> includes not only quick CV creating, editing and customizing, but also professional CV format that highlights your profile. Together with the Preview PDF function, it allows you to preview your CV after saving and send it by email. <\/p>\n<p>What you need to do is just entering required information in default fields that are Personal Information, Professional Goal, Academic Formation, Qualifications, Experiences and Additional Information. <strong>Curriculum Manager<\/strong> will do the entire job by immediately creating an awesome resume with your input data.

Lots of people might think that is an expense because there are thousands of sources out there for super cheap even free web template. In my opinion, however, it&#8217;s not! Developing a custom website for your business will be considered as <strong>a smart investment<\/strong>, and the one that <strong>helps your business grow<\/strong>. You doubt it, don&#8217;t you?<\/p>\n<p>So, this time instead of convincing you to believe my words, I will let you make this case clear by yourself through answering these below questions: <\/p>\n<h3>Is your website truly your?<\/h3>\n<p>Are you the one making decision about what you want for your website? Can you totally nix part that you don&#8217;t like? Are you in control, not some dull templates? <\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1005\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/custom-web-design1.jpg\" alt=\"Advantages of custom web design\" width=\"800\" height=\"491\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1005\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">If you&#8217;re using a template, sorry, the answer is definitely NO.<\/p><\/div><br \/>\nTemplate do not allow so much rooms for your personalization. They restrict your website&#8217;s appearance and functionality. On the contrary, custom web design hands you the marverllous power of control over every details of YOUR website. That power not only allows you to tailor every aspect of your site exactly as you expect, but also avoid copying from others.<\/p>\n<h3>Is your website memorable?<\/h3>\n<p>How can you differentiate yourself from the crowd when wearing the exact same clothes like others? Okay, your face may be a little different with the makeup you did by your own, but who care when they just look at you in 3 seconds then leave? <\/p>\n<p>It goes the same with your website. Most people leave after just one glimpse at your site. So, to make them remember your website, you have to keep them interested and make the site absolute unique which a template can not deliver. <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.awwwards.com\/awards\/gallery\/2015\/09\/6-web-design-trends-awwwards-image08.gif\" alt=\"testgif\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-607\" \/><br \/>\nHaving a custom web design give you an opportunity to be yourself and push your business to one step further. <\/p>\n<h3>Are you serious about your business?<\/h3>\n<p>Templates make your website look generic and non credible. As a result, your business seem more like a place of amusement than a professional business. In fact, you do not look for a click, do you? What you are looking for is the potential visitors who are willing to browse through your site and get to know who you are. Then, if those perspectives don&#8217;t feel that you are really serious about your business, how can they purchase for your services? <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2016-design-trends-13.png\" alt=\"Advantages of custom web design\" width=\"1233\" height=\"623\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-614\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Custom web design allows you to develop a very carefully branded site which make your site look more professional. Therefore, even though custom website takes more money and time at first, in the long run, it can attract more visitors who may turn into your customers. <\/p>\n<h3>Will people visit your website?<\/h3>\n<p>Don&#8217;t indulge in illusion that just because you build a website, people will find it and interact with it. Oh no! That&#8217;s not how it works! This silly thought is like you hold a party and not inviting anyone, but still assume that people will come. How can? <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/googledrive.com\/host\/0B-wsJdPXUTeIS1RELUFTLU13ckk\/DesignveloperLibGif\/le-mugs.gif\" alt=\"testgif\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-607\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Well, search engine optimization is responsible for this difficult task. It always plays a critical role of any websites. Building a custom web design with valid HTML, CSS code and helpful unique information is what search engine love. Template is unable to do that!<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>I hope that my post helped you make up your decision. One more thing: to be sure you chose a competent and professional web design, before deciding, don&#8217;t hesitate to dig into some online resources to proofread and get necessary information.<\/p>\n<p>If you end up to choose having a custom web design, then I certainly encourage you to give <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designveloper.com\/\">Designveloper<\/a> a call.

The author is <strong>Khang Nguyen<\/strong>, a young talent member of <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.designveloper.com\/\">Designveloper<\/a><\/strong>. This article is based on his writing, you can read the original one <a href=\"http:\/\/nlhuykhang.github.io\/javascript\/framework\/2016\/07\/27\/meteor-deep-dive-tracker.html\">here<\/a>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Introduction<\/h2>\n<p>As a Meteor developer, I believe that everyone who has worked with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.meteor.com\/\">Meteor<\/a> all had experience with Tracker, or at least used it through some kinds of interfaces like getMeteordata or createContainer which come with the react-meteor-data package.<\/p>\n<p>However, not all people know how Tracker works its magic. In this post, I&#8217;m going to dig into every facet of this case as well as bring to you a little bit of background knowledge.<\/p>\n<h2>What Is Tracker?<\/h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/meteor\/meteor\/tree\/devel\/packages\/tracker\">Tracker<\/a> is a Meteor&#8217;s core package<\/strong>, it is small but incredibly powerful library for <strong>transparent reactive programming<\/strong> in Meteor.<\/p>\n<p>Using Tracker you have much of the power of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Functional_reactive_programming\">Functional Reactive Programming FRP<\/a> system without following FRP&#8217;s principles when implementing your application. Combined with Tracker-aware libraries, like Session\/ReactiveVar\/ReactiveDict, this lets you build complex event-driven programs without writing a lot of boilerplate event-handling code.<\/p>\n<h2>What Make It Great?<\/h2>\n<p>In a nutshell, it is reactivity. In my opinion, it is the strongest aspect of Meteor. Tracker helps us make our system work reactively both on client and server with ease. We do not have to learn any extra stuffs about reactive programming or functional programming to get started. <\/p>\n<p>Just read the Tracker api and do the work then the magic happens. Or even some Meteor-novice who do not know a thing about Tracker, their code still work reactively. Do you know what am I talking about? It is good old <a href=\"https:\/\/guide.meteor.com\/blaze.html\">Blaze<\/a> (I say it\u2019s old because I already moved to React for all new projects). <\/p>\n<p>Blaze\u2019s helpers are reactive natively because they use Tracker inside, if you put inside them a <a href=\"http:\/\/richsilv.github.io\/meteor\/meteor-reactive-data-types\/\">reactive data source<\/a> then whenever that source changes those helpers will be recomputed and you get new data on the screen.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s read some code and behold what I am talking about, if you are already familiar with Tracker, skip this part and move to the next section to inspect the magic.<\/p>\n<pre>\/\/ Set up the reactive code\r\nconst counter1 = new ReactiveVar(0);\r\nconst counter2 = new ReactiveVar(0);\r\n\r\nconst observeCounter = function() {\r\n  Tracker.autorun(function() {\r\n    const text = `Counter1 is now: ${counter1.get()}`;\r\n    console.warn(text);\r\n  });\r\n  console.warn(`Counter2 is now: ${counter2.get()}`);\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst computation = Tracker.autorun(observeCounter);\r\n\r\n\/*\r\nMessage on the console:\r\nCounter1 is now: 0\r\nCounter2 is now: 0\r\n*\/\r\n\r\n\/\/ and now change the counter1's value\r\ncounter1.set(1);\r\n\/*\r\nMessage on the console:\r\nCounter1 is now: 1\r\n*\/\r\n\r\ncounter2.set(3);\r\n\/*\r\nMessage on the console:\r\nCounter1 is now: 1\r\nCounter2 is now: 3\r\n*\/\r\n\r\ncounter1.set(7);\r\n\/*\r\nMessage on the console:\r\nCounter1 is now: 7\r\n*\/<\/pre>\n<p>In reality, it happens as shown below:<br \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/0414032aa1cc5c948f1d94bc4c4e831cbbabf005.googledrive.com\/host\/0B-wsJdPXUTeIS1RELUFTLU13ckk\/tracker.gif\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-607\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>How Does Tracker Work?<\/h2>\n<p>Basically Tracker is a simple interface that lets reactive data sources (like <em>counter<\/em> in the example above) talk to reactive data consumers (the observeCounter function). Below is the flow of Tracker (I ignore some good parts to make it as simple as possible) <\/p>\n<li>Call Tracker.autorun with function F<\/li>\n<li>If inside F, there is a reactive data source named R, then that source will add F to its dependence list<\/li>\n<li>Then whenever the value of R changes, R will retrieve all its dependence from the dependence list and run them.<\/li>\n<p>Everything is easier said than done. So, let&#8217;s take a look at the code:<\/p>\n<pre>const counter = new ReactiveVar(1);\r\n\r\n  const f = function() {\r\n    console.log(counter.get());\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  Tracker.autorun(f);<\/pre>\n<p>In the above code: counter is our reactive data source. It raises a question is that how can it know what function used inside to add that function as its dependence?<\/p>\n<p>This is where the Meteor team does their trick to make this flow transparent. In fact, Tracker is an implementation of the Observer pattern or at least an Observer-liked pattern. Observer pattern can be used to create a reactive library like Tracker.<\/p>\n<p>In an traditional implementation of Observer, we can think of F as an observer and R as a subject. R must have an interface to add F as its observer and notify\/run F when its value changes. Something like this:<\/p>\n<pre>const counter = new Source();\r\n\r\n  const f = function(val) {\r\n    console.log(val);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  counter.addObserver(f);<\/pre>\n<p>To imitate this, Tracker provides us these interface:<\/p>\n<li>Tracker.autorun<\/li>\n<li>Tracker.Dependency<\/li>\n<li>Tracker.Dependency.prototype.depend<\/li>\n<li>Tracker.Dependency.prototype.changed<\/li>\n<p>Tracker.Dependency is the implementation of Subject in traditional Observer. All of reactive data source to use with Tracker use this object inside.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at the basic implementation of ReactiveVar I use for examples above:<\/p>\n<pre>ReactiveVar = function (initialValue, equalsFunc) {\r\n    if (! (this instanceof ReactiveVar))\r\n      \/\/ called without `new`\r\n      return new ReactiveVar(initialValue, equalsFunc);\r\n\r\n    this.curValue = initialValue;\r\n    this.equalsFunc = equalsFunc;\r\n    this.dep = new Tracker.Dependency;\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  ReactiveVar.prototype.get = function () {\r\n    if (Tracker.active)\r\n      this.dep.depend();\r\n\r\n    return this.curValue;\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  ReactiveVar.prototype.set = function (newValue) {\r\n    var oldValue = this.curValue;\r\n\r\n    if ((this.equalsFunc || ReactiveVar._isEqual)(oldValue, newValue))\r\n      \/\/ value is same as last time\r\n      return;\r\n\r\n    this.curValue = newValue;\r\n    this.dep.changed();\r\n  };<\/pre>\n<p>So when we create a new instance of ReactiveVar, a Tracker.Dependency object will be created. This object will have two main functions: <strong>depend<\/strong> and <strong>changed<\/strong> with get call inside <strong>get<\/strong> and <strong>set<\/strong> function respectively.<\/p>\n<p>This is the Tracker\u2019s flow with more details:<\/p>\n<p>Tracker.autorun will create a computation with the function (F) pass to it as the computation\u2019s props.<\/p>\n<pre>\/\/ https:\/\/github.com\/meteor\/meteor\/blob\/devel\/packages\/tracker\/tracker.js#L569-L585\r\n  Tracker.autorun = function(f, options) {\r\n    \/\/ ...\r\n    var c = new Tracker.Computation(f, Tracker.currentComputation, options.onError);\r\n\r\n    \/\/ ...\r\n\r\n    return c;\r\n  };<\/pre>\n<p>When being initiated, this computation is also set as the current computation inside a \u201cglobal\u201d variable named Tracker.currentComputation. And F will be run for the first time.<\/p>\n<pre>\/\/ https:\/\/github.com\/meteor\/meteor\/blob\/devel\/packages\/tracker\/tracker.js#L146-L208\r\n  Tracker.Computation = function(f, parent, onError) {\r\n    \/\/ ...\r\n    self._func = f;\r\n    self._onError = onError;\r\n    self._recomputing = false;\r\n\r\n    var errored = true;\r\n    try {\r\n      self._compute();\r\n      errored = false;\r\n    } finally {\r\n      self.firstRun = false;\r\n      if (errored)\r\n        self.stop();\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  \/\/ https:\/\/github.com\/meteor\/meteor\/blob\/devel\/packages\/tracker\/tracker.js#L302-L316\r\n  Tracker.Computation.prototype._compute = function() {\r\n    var self = this;\r\n    self.invalidated = false;\r\n\r\n    var previous = Tracker.currentComputation;\r\n    setCurrentComputation(self);\r\n    var previousInCompute = inCompute;\r\n    inCompute = true;\r\n    try {\r\n      withNoYieldsAllowed(self._func)(self);\r\n    } finally {\r\n      setCurrentComputation(previous);\r\n      inCompute = previousInCompute;\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  \/\/ https:\/\/github.com\/meteor\/meteor\/blob\/devel\/packages\/tracker\/tracker.js#L29-L32\r\n  var setCurrentComputation = function(c) {\r\n    Tracker.currentComputation = c;\r\n    Tracker.active = !!c;\r\n  };<\/pre>\n<p>If there is a .get operation (meaning .depend) inside body of F , this function will be run and set the current computation stored in the global var named Tracker.currentComputation as it&#8217;s dependent.<\/p>\n<pre>\/\/ https:\/\/github.com\/meteor\/meteor\/blob\/devel\/packages\/tracker\/tracker.js#L403-L420\r\n  Tracker.Dependency.prototype.depend = function(computation) {\r\n    if (!computation) {\r\n      \/\/ ...\r\n      computation = Tracker.currentComputation;\r\n    }\r\n    var self = this;\r\n    var id = computation._id;\r\n\r\n    if (!(id in self._dependentsById)) {\r\n      self._dependentsById[id] = computation;\r\n      \/\/ ...\r\n      return true;\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n  };<\/pre>\n<p>Then whenever .set is call (meaning .changed), F will be rerun<\/p>\n<pre>\/\/ https:\/\/github.com\/meteor\/meteor\/blob\/devel\/packages\/tracker\/tracker.js#L428-L432\r\n  Tracker.Dependency.prototype.changed = function() {\r\n    var self = this;\r\n    for (var id in self._dependentsById)\r\n      self._dependentsById[id].invalidate();\r\n  };<\/pre>\n<p>Yeah so it is the basic idea. Beyond this basic flow actually there are some other important things to be take care for to have a complete production-ready Tracker library. I am not going to write about those things, instead I will just name them. And you can go and check yourself for a deeper understanding of Tracker. They are:<\/p>\n<li>Tracker inside Tracker (computation inside computation)<\/li>\n<li>Clear stopped computations<\/li>\n<li>Prevent infinite loop<\/li>\n<h2>Takeaways<\/h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve discovered so far:<\/p>\n<li>Tracker make it possible to do reactive programming in Meteor<\/li>\n<li>It is an observer-liked implementation<\/li>\n<li>A good trick: use a \u201cglobal currentComputation\u201d to implement transparent Observer<\/li>\n<li>Those guys who wrote Tracker are awesome \ud83d\ude09<\/li>\n<p>So, did you find some great information of your own in this blog?

If you are still wondering what single-page site actually is, then read that word &#8220;Single-page&#8221; again! Its name already told it all! Basically, it&#8217;s nothing but a single page without any additional pages. <\/p>\n<p>One thing makes it special is the navigation of the page are linked to some particular sections of that page. You just need to click to any of navigating links, the page will do its job bringing you to that particular section. Or you can go there by scrolling the mouse and taking the journey by your own. You see, in the world that people seem to be bombarded with too much content, the simplicity and straight-to-the-point of single-page websites will be the users&#8217; ideal choices. <\/p>\n<p>To make my point clear, I bring to you a full list of <strong>benefits of using single-page websites<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<h2>Say Goodbye To Loading&#8230;And&#8230;Loading<\/h2>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/hostingfacts.com\/\">Hosting Facts<\/a>, <em>&#8220;A single second delay in your website loading time can result in a 7% loss in conversion, and 40% of web users will abandon a website if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load&#8221;<\/em>. Nobody likes waiting for so long! It&#8217;s quite obviously that attracting a potential customer is hard enough, grabbing their interest and retaining them is even more difficult. Then, the question is how can we do that?<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/benefits-of-single-page-websites1.gif\" alt=\"Reasons why single-page websites will be the future of the web\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-807\" \/> <\/p>\n<p>With single-page websites, everything will be a piece of cake! The single web pages load much more faster. Everything visitors need is on the first and only page! Visitors accessing to your pages are just like joining a buffet party without line where they can get to exactly what they&#8217;re looking for.<\/p>\n<h2>Much Cheaper<\/h2>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/benefits-of-single-page-websites2.jpg\" alt=\"Reasons why single-page websites will be the future of the web\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-809\" \/><\/p>\n<p>With traditional websites, you have to design and develop numerous pages that not only waste your time, but also squander your money. Single-page websites give you a hand to take away all this mess. Just one page with a description for each of the product is sufficient! You don&#8217;t have to create tons of pages which contain less than four sentence each.  Additionally, one page sites tend to be smaller which saves on your web spaces, bandwidth expenses and result in reduced hosting cost.<\/p>\n<h2>Quality Over Quantity<\/h2>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/benefits-of-single-page-websites4.jpg\" alt=\"Reasons why single-page websites will be the future of the web\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1032\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-810\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When you have a single-page website, there&#8217;s not so much place for you to clutter up. You&#8217;re forced to simplify thing to their essential components. Truth be told is your visitors aren&#8217;t looking for essays. Who has got the time to read volumes of text unless a person is here to read a novel? What they want to know is who you are and what you do. A good single-page site should concentrate on what sets you apart and why YOUR company is the one visitors need.<\/p>\n<h2>Scrolling Is Intuitive<\/h2>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/googledrive.com\/host\/0B-wsJdPXUTeIS1RELUFTLU13ckk\/DesignveloperLibGif\/le-mugs.gif\" alt=\"testgif\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-607\" \/><\/p>\n<p>According to a recent study conducted over the internet: <em>&#8220;People prefer to stay and scroll across the same page rather than having to click through multiple pages before they find what they are looking for&#8221;<\/em>. Infinitely scrolling offers visitors some pretty exciting experience. They scroll down, there&#8217;s more so they continue to go down some more. That somehow makes visitors curious and keeps them stay longer. <\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_929\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/benefits-of-single-page-websites7.jpg\" alt=\"Reasons why single-page websites will be the future of the web\" width=\"800\" height=\"648\" class=\"size-full wp-image-929\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Moreover, it also opens the door for us to use storytelling to increase conversation and inspire visitors to take action.<\/p><\/div>\n<h2>Differentiate You<\/h2>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/benefits-of-single-page-websites5-1.jpg\" alt=\"Reasons why single-page websites will be the future of the web\" width=\"800\" height=\"649\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-918\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When designing a multiple website, noone want to take a risk because a miss is as good as a mile.

He also expressed he would love to come our next meetup.<\/p>\n<p>We had a short interview with <strong>Toan<\/strong>, a developer. He found that the meetup quite helpful and interesting. There is no doubt that Toan will see us again at the upcoming events.<\/p>\n<p>Besides, the number of participants was much more than the number we had planned. So, it was a pity that there was some chaos in organization. That&#8217;s why we also received some complaints about inconvenient seats and some invaluable advice on how to improve the quality of meetup. We sincerely concern and apologize that we fell short on your expectations in some areas. We highly appreciated all of your feedback and will use it to evaluate changes and make improvements in our next events.<\/p>\n<p>As usual, the hard work starts again when we all return home and get back to actually executing on our plans and working through all of the challenges that we each face. The good news is we will all be getting back together face-to-face on September. Just like a young talent developer &#8211; <strong>Phuc Nguyen<\/strong> said: <em>&#8220;All of us are always learning, all of us are difference&#8221;<\/em>, it would be our pleasure to have you as presenter sharing advice for the next meetup. <\/p>\n<p>We will have 2 other blogs for 2 topics of the meetup for you to easily follow.

It is usually used and referred to as a scripting language, allow programmers to churn out large quantities of codes in short periods of time.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_712\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Programming-languages-for-beginner1.png\" alt=\"The best programming languages for the first time learners\" width=\"800\" height=\"415\" class=\"size-full wp-image-712\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">It\u2019s great language for beginner all the way up to seasoned professionals.<\/p><\/div>\n<h3>JavaScript &#8211; The Most Useful Language<\/h3>\n<p>There is no doubt that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.javascript.com\/\"><strong>JavaScript<\/strong><\/a> is one of the world most popular and powerful programming language. It is the only language available for client-side scripting in the web development. That makes it virtually a necessity for everyone who wants to be successful as a programmer for web and a must learn for front-end developers. Pages without JavaScript are rather bland, whereas JavaScript laced sites allow for animation and better control over the web interface. It is dynamic and flexible to use on object-oriented programming.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_713\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Programming-languages-for-beginner2.png\" alt=\"The best programming languages for the first time learners\" width=\"800\" height=\"356\" class=\"size-full wp-image-713\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">It&#8217;s used to spice up web page by making them interactive<\/p><\/div>\n<h3>Ruby and Ruby on Rails &#8211; The Happy Language<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/rubyonrails.org\/\"><strong>Ruby on rails<\/strong><\/a> is a great tool that can help you with the backend aspect of your programming. Although Ruby and Ruby on Rail have similar names, there&#8217;s actually an important difference: Ruby is scripting language, like Python, but Ruby on Rail is web app framework built on Ruby. <\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_715\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Programming-languages-for-beginner3.jpg\" alt=\"The best programming languages for the first time learners\" width=\"800\" height=\"586\" class=\"size-full wp-image-715\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rail is so fun for beginner because it&#8217;s really robust and it does so much of the hard work for you.<\/p><\/div><br \/>\nLearning to program in Ruby is much easier than other language because the language is super flexible and very forgiving, which translate to more time spend absorbing programming fundamentals, less time banging your head against your desk.<\/p>\n<h3>Get familiar with C<\/h3>\n<p>One thing that is importance about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cprogramming.com\/\"><strong>C<\/strong><\/a>: it&#8217;s one of the most foundational languages in computer science and programming. If you can grab C in your hands, other popular languages is just kids in your eyes! However, before jumping into C, you should proofread it on <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Main_Page\">Wikipedia<\/a> and other online resources to find out whether you should learn it or not. It&#8217;s because C requires more complex code to perform simple task, you may find it touch to keep yourself motivated if you join it as your first language.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_871\" style=\"width: 1290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/Programming-languages-for-beginner4.jpg\" alt=\"The best programming languages for the first time learners\" width=\"1280\" height=\"600\" class=\"size-full wp-image-871\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Knowledge of C will definitely help you as programmer.<\/p><\/div>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>The nice thing is that, when you&#8217;ve taken the first step, the second step is much easier regardless of the direction it takes you. Remember, the best way to learn programming is by getting your hands dirty. You&#8217;ll be the best solider when you are fighting the real world enemy.<\/p>\n<p>So, which programming language did you choose to learn first? Does it work?

There is a saying that goes: <em>&#8220;If you are not ahead of the times, you are behind them&#8221;<\/em>. It&#8217;s perfectly true! As a web designer, it&#8217;s essential to know what the current and upcoming trends are. It helps you not only stay ahead the competitions, but also meeting your clients&#8217;s expectations.<\/p>\n<p>Without any further delay, let&#8217;s get started to examine these <strong> web designing trends<\/strong> dominating in 2016.<\/p>\n<h2>Micro-interactions<\/h2>\n<p>A young software developer, <strong>Nick Babich<\/strong> said that: <em>&#8220;The best product do two things well: features and details. Features are what draw people to your products. Details are what keep them there. And details are what actually make our app stand out from our competition&#8221;<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>This saying is one of the most concise ways of describing how crucial micro-interactions are! From tapping an alarm to turn it off, liking a Facebook post to setting a status message, micro-interactions seem to happen all around us. They are an <strong>important part of almost every design project<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2016-design-trends-4.gif\" alt=\"Web design trends in 2016\" width=\"800\" height=\"551\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-590\" \/><br \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2016-design-trends-1.gif\" alt=\"Web design trends in 2016\" width=\"928\" height=\"640\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-585\" \/><br \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2016-design-trends-3.gif\" alt=\"Web design trends in 2016\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-589\" \/><\/p>\n<p>People always want to be heard, seen or listened to. So, there is no doubt that if you design a website that does not include some elements or moments which user need to interact with, they won&#8217;t spend much time per their visit. Long story short, micro-interactions make devices more human-like in their moments. As a result, the design is more usable and enjoyable.<\/p>\n<h2>Card Layouts<\/h2>\n<p>Cards have been known as a visual way to communicate between people for a long time. In fact, we are using cards everyday. We send birthday cards, greet cards. When we travel, we send back postcards. My wallet is also full of cards such as: credit cards, debit cards, store cards, even driving license having the standardized format of card, etc. <\/p>\n<p>Taking advantages of this idea, card layouts were born and now become very popular in web design. In a nutshell, cards play a role of &#8220;<strong>content container<\/strong>&#8221; into which all the most relevant information about a certain topic will be organized. <\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_598\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2016-design-trends-5.jpg\" alt=\"Web design trends in 2016\" width=\"800\" height=\"384\" class=\"size-full wp-image-598\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Speaking of card design, we can\u2019t avoid mentioning <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.com\/\">Pinterest<\/a>.<\/p><\/div><br \/>\n<div id=\"attachment_597\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2016-design-trends-4.png\" alt=\"Web design trends in 2016\" width=\"800\" height=\"455\" class=\"size-full wp-image-597\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Today, the influence of cards is also spreading out cross many other sites<\/p><\/div><br \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2016-design-trends-6.png\" alt=\"Web design trends in 2016\" width=\"800\" height=\"531\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-600\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Suppose you have a site with a lot of data that need to be scanned, then the card layout is the best choice. <\/p>\n<h2>Flat designs and Material design<\/h2>\n<p>Flat design is always the most designer&#8217;s favorite choice and it isn&#8217;t going anywhere anytime soon.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_601\" style=\"width: 710px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2016-design-trends-7.png\" alt=\"Web design trends in 2016\" width=\"700\" height=\"340\" class=\"size-full wp-image-601\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">With this design, the color will fill the page, it makes the page more vibrant.<\/p><\/div>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2016-design-trends-8.png\" alt=\"Web design trends in 2016\" width=\"800\" height=\"429\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-620\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, for those who prefer a more realistic approach, you can choose material design which is a simple google&#8217;s design layered language.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_622\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2016-design-trends-10.jpg\" alt=\"Web design trends in 2016\" width=\"800\" height=\"420\" class=\"size-full wp-image-622\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Material design gives more depth to flat design by incorporating light and shadows, while featuring grid-based layouts and responsive animations.<\/p><\/div>\n<h2>Animation<\/h2>\n<p>The web has never looked more vigorous than it does today. Cool animations are used more and more to enhance a site&#8217;s storytelling. They make a site seem more like a communication where visitors can interact than a simple portal to find information.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/googledrive.com\/host\/0B-wsJdPXUTeIS1RELUFTLU13ckk\/DesignveloperLibGif\/make-me-pulse.gif\" alt=\"testgif\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-607\" \/><br \/>\nFrom smooth animated gifs to small hover animated or page loader, it&#8217;s the perfect tool to draw users&#8217; attention. <\/p>\n<h4>Long Scrolling<\/h4>\n<p>The days of &#8220;above the fold&#8221; are over. Long scrolling sites are more and more common lately. It&#8217;s the increased usage of mobile screen making the success of the long scroll.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/googledrive.com\/host\/0B-wsJdPXUTeIS1RELUFTLU13ckk\/DesignveloperLibGif\/le-mugs.gif\" alt=\"testgif\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-607\" \/><br \/>\nLong Scrolling offers us designers the opportunity to tell a story, promote interaction. Infinitely scrolling sites also entices user to stay longer. Especially, it works well with touch controls and opens the door for more intense, immersive experiences.<\/p>\n<h2>Fewer photo, more illustration<\/h2>\n<p>Illustrations connect with users a more personal way than photos do. They offer a warmth and a stunning depth of originality that simply can&#8217;t be matched by other visuals and add a unique element distinguishing your works from others.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_611\" style=\"width: 1253px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2016-design-trends-12.jpg\" alt=\"Web design trends in 2016\" width=\"1243\" height=\"637\" class=\"size-full wp-image-611\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Illustrations will bring a rich taste of art to your websites.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Meanwhile, will you use illustrations in your works?<\/p>\n<h2>Responsive Website Design<\/h2>\n<p>Want to know what responsive design is? Let&#8217;s open this blog on a desktop browser, then slowly make the browser thinner and wider. Do you see it? The layout magically adjusts itself to fit any sizes of the browser. That is how responsive websites work!<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/2016-design-trends-15.jpg\" alt=\"Web design trends in 2016\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1032\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-855\" \/><br \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/2016-design-trends-16.jpg\" alt=\"Web design trends in 2016\" width=\"1086\" height=\"876\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-856\" \/><br \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/2016-design-trends-17.jpg\" alt=\"Web design trends in 2016\" width=\"627\" height=\"1026\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-857\" \/>  <\/p>\n<p>With this design, instead of creating different websites for different devices, you just need to rearrange the elements to fit into any screen sizes. Your sites will look awesome everywhere. It&#8217;s time to say goodbye to zoom on smaller device to read content. Visitors will get better experience. And as a result, you will get more happy visitors which also lead to more happy clients.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>With the aim of saving time in our day-to-day workflow, these trends clearly show a real concerted effort to make the process of building website much easier.<\/p>\n<p>Of course the most popular trends are not always the best choice and they also do not mean &#8220;new&#8221;, but they are good tools to have waiting in the wings should you need them.<\/p>\n<p>Your turn!

If you are a Meteor-novice, no worries! You can discover more about this full-stack JavaScript platform for developing single-page, real time web and mobile apps at <a href=\"https:\/\/guide.meteor.com\">Meteor.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Now, are you ready to get what you missed at our Meetup?<\/p>\n<h3>SQL INJECTION<\/h3>\n<p>SQL Injection is defined as a code injection technique, used to attack data-driven applications, in which nefarious SQL statement are inserted into an entry field for execution. (Source: Wikipedia)<\/p>\n<p>In other words, SQL injection is a technique where malicious users inject SQL commands into an SQL statement to change it and compromises the security of a web application with SQL database.<\/p>\n<p>There are 4 common forms of technical implementations of SQL injection:<\/p>\n<li>Incorrectly Filtered Escape Characters with this line of code:<\/li>\n<pre>statement = \"SELECT*FROMusersWHERE name = '\" + userName + \"';\"<\/pre>\n<li>Incorrectly Type Handling:<\/li>\n<pre>statement := \"SELECT*FROMuserinfoWHEREid=\" + a_variable + \";\"<\/pre>\n<li>Blind SQL Injection:<\/li>\n<pre>SELECT*FROMbookreviewsWHEREID='Value(ID)';<\/pre>\n<li>Second order SQL injection\n<p>I am going to give you an example of Incorrectly Filtered Character. Here I want to get a user data with username Peter and password &#8220;$PWQ&#8221;, the query looks something like this:<\/p>\n<pre>\/\/ query\r\nSELECT * FROMusers \r\nWHERE username='peter\u2019\r\nAND (password=('$PWD'))<\/pre>\n<p>If I use a &#8220;weird&#8221; input, for example: <\/p>\n<pre>\/\/ input\r\n' OR '1'='1\u2019<\/pre>\n<p>The result query is:<\/p>\n<pre>\/\/ result\r\nSELECT * FROM users \r\nWHERE username='peter' AND (password='' OR '1'='1')<\/pre>\n<p>As you can see, the condition (password=&#8221; OR &#8216;1&#8217;=&#8217;1&#8242;) is always true. That&#8217;s why the result query is always successful. By this way, attackers can get any arbitrary user data, given the username.<\/p>\n<h3>NOSQL INJECTION<\/h3>\n<p>Now, although NoSQL is still a popular attacking technique, it&#8217;s no longer as widespread as it used to be. Many modern apps use NoSQL databases such as MongoDB for its simplicity and speed. Unlike SQL in which queries use STRINGs as the control mechanism, NoSQL queries use OBJECTs instead. With NoSQL Injection, instead of injecting STRINGS as parameters, attackers use SUB-OBJECTs as parameters to inject database queries.<\/p>\n<p>The SQL statement that we used above to query the user login details will be written like this in MongoDB:<\/p>\n<pre>db.users.find({username: username, password: password});<\/pre>\n<p>As mentioned before, attackers can use subobjects as parameters to inject to NoSQL database queries, for example:<\/p>\n<pre>db.users.find({\r\n\tusername: \u201cpeter\u201d,\r\n\tpassword: { $gt: \u201c\u201d }\r\n})<\/pre>\n<p>In the above query, the $gt operators stands for &#8220;greater than&#8221;. The password is not validated to ensure that it is string. Therefore, when the JSON document is deserialized, that field may contain anything but string that can be used to manipulate the structure of the query. You can get that what the query does is comparing the password of &#8220;peter&#8221; with an empty string, so this condition is always true.<\/p>\n<p>In MongoDB, there&#8217;re many similar operators, like $gt that attackers can take advantage of, such as: $gte (greater than or equal to), $lt (less than), $lte (less than or equal to), $ne (not equal to), $nin (matches none of the values specified in an array), etc.<\/p>\n<h3>NOSQL INJECTION IN METEOR APPLICATION<\/h3>\n<p>Here comes the Meteor part. Typically the default data layer of Meteor applications in MongoDB, which puts Meteor apps in the risk of being exploited using the NoSQL Injection technique. Let&#8217;s get into one demo application for testing NoSQL Injection: meteor-shop. you can clone the app from <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sonlexqt\/meteor-shop\">https:\/\/github.com\/sonlexqt\/meteor-shop<\/a>. This web application is written in Meteor. Please follow the instruction in README.md file for how to setup and run the app in your local machine.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/noSQL-injection-in-meteor-apps1.jpg\" alt=\"All thing about NoSQL Injection in Meteor Application\" width=\"771\" height=\"478\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-823\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In the scope of Meteor, attackers usually take advantage of publication functions and methods. For example, you can see that in the publication.js file we have this publication function:<\/p>\n<pre>\/\/ Get the products, filtered by their vendor\r\nMeteor.publish(\"products-by-vendor\", function(slug){\r\n  return Products.find({\"vendor.slug\" : slug})\r\n});<\/pre>\n<p>We (as developer) are expecting the slug information to be a string, but haven&#8217;t check for that condition. So whatever input can be injected into this function, which makes it vulnerable to NoSQL Injection. For example. an attackers can do this (in browser console) to get all the documents in the Products collections:<\/p>\n<pre>Meteor.subscribe(\u201cproducts-by-vendor\u201d, { $ne: null })\r\nProducts.find().fetch() \/\/ Now all products in the database are shown !<\/pre>\n<p>You can take a look at the server\/publication.js file and meetup.js file. Those files contain some examples to help you play around with NoSQL in the demo app.<\/p>\n<h3>SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM<\/h3>\n<p>Through those example above, hopefully you can see the potential of NoSQL Injection being a threat to apps using NoSQL databases. So how do we prevent this problem?<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, it&#8217;s pretty easy in the scope of Meteor to prevent the app from being attacked by NoSQL Injection. In general, there&#8217;s only one thing to keep in mind: <strong>Never completely trust user inputs<\/strong>. We must always get them validated before passing them as parameters to publication functions and methods. Meteor has a handy package which do the exact same thing called <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/atmospherejs.com\/meteor\/check\">check<\/a><\/strong>. This package will allow us developers to check if the input parameter match the defined type. So, one can&#8217;t inject a JavaScript object as parameter to a function which requires a string, for example.<\/p>\n<p>The check package is quite useful but what if your project has so many publication functions\/methods that you don&#8217;t know if their parameters have been checked or not? Then here comes <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/atmospherejs.com\/meteor\/audit-argument-checks\">audit-argument-check<\/a><\/strong> and <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/East5th\/check-checker\">check-checker<\/a><\/strong>, those package will throw warnings if there&#8217;re methods that haven&#8217;t been checked by the check package.<\/p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up!<\/h3>\n<p>Walking through this blog, we&#8217;ve discovered more about NoSQL Injection:<\/p>\n<li>How it works and some examples<\/li>\n<li>How to prevent it in general and in the scope of Meteor<\/li>\n<p>So, did you find some great information of your own in this blog?

I&#8217;m going to show you how to bring your app into practice.<\/p>\n<h4>Step 1: Create Servers<\/h4>\n<p>To begin with, I create 4 servers in AWS (Amazon Web Service) with 4 different IP addresses:<\/p>\n<p>I have chosen the domain which is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ami.com\">www.ami.com<\/a> for the app. I use MongoDB because it is the default database of Meteor. There we&#8217;ve got:<\/p>\n<li>\n<ul>MONGODB: 54.174.9.184, 54.174.9.185, 54.174.9.186, 54.174.9.187.<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<ul>METEOR APP: 54.174.9.188 (sever-1.ami.com), 54.174.9.189 (server-2.ami.com), 54.174.9.190 (server-3.ami.com), 54.174.9.191 (server-4.ami.com)<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<h4>Step 2: Install MonggoDB Replication<\/h4>\n<p>Replication sets provide redundancy and increase data availability on different database servers. Hence, I apply replication to increase the performance of reading operations.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_748\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/how-to-deploy-meteor-app1.jpg\" alt=\"Learning how to deploy and scale a meteor app\" width=\"800\" height=\"293\" class=\"size-full wp-image-748\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">MongoDB Replication<\/p><\/div><br \/>\nAt first, I <strong>create an admin user<\/strong> following precise instructions on <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.mongodb.com\/v2.6\/tutorial\/add-user-administrator\/\">https:\/\/docs.mongodb.com\/v2.6\/tutorial\/add-user-administrator\/<\/a> and <strong>generate a key-file<\/strong> by doing exactly guides on <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.mongodb.com\/v2.6\/tutorial\/generate-key-file\/\">https:\/\/docs.mongodb.com\/v2.6\/tutorial\/generate-key-file\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Next, I apply <strong>SSH<\/strong> (Secure Shell) to all of 4 servers and run these following commands<\/p>\n<pre>>cd ~\/\r\n> mkdir mongodb\/\r\n> screen -S mongodb\r\n> mongod --dbpath mongodb\/ --replSet Ami --auth --keyFile mongo-keyfile<\/pre>\n<p>To close terminal session, I use the hotkeys <strong>&#8220;CTRL + a + d&#8221;<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Then I <strong>turn 54.174.9.184 into primary MongoDB<\/strong> by running these following commands:<\/p>\n<pre>> mongo\r\n> use admin\r\n> db.auth(\u2018admin\u2019, \u2018password\u2019)\r\n> rs.initiate()\r\n> rs.add(\u201854.174.9.185:27017\u2019)\r\n> rs.add(\u201854.174.9.186:27017\u2019)\r\n> rs.add(\u201854.174.9.187:27017\u2019)<\/pre>\n<h4>Step 3: Setup your application<\/h4>\n<p>In order to set up the app, the first thing I need to do is to <strong>install meteor up <\/strong> by using npm. Below is the command line to use:<\/p>\n<pre>> npm install -g mup<\/pre>\n<p>Setting up is a must. To do this, use the <strong>cd path command<\/strong> to go to the folder which contains settings file of the application:<\/p>\n<pre>> cd path\/to\/settings\r\n> mup init<\/pre>\n<p>This is how I scale the app. In this file, I edit <strong>mup.json<\/strong> file by:<\/p>\n<li><strong>Adding servers<\/strong><\/li>\n<pre>{\r\n      \"host\": \"server-1.ami.com\",\r\n      \"username\": \"ubuntu\",\r\n      \"pem\": \".\/ssh.pem\",\r\n      \"env\": {\r\n        \"CLUSTER_ENDPOINT_URL\": \"https:\/\/server-1.ami.com\",\r\n        \"CLUSTER_BALANCER_URL\": \"https:\/\/server-1.ami.com\"\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"host\": \"server-2.ami.com\",\r\n      \"username\": \"ubuntu\",\r\n      \"pem\": \".\/ssh.pem\",\r\n      \"env\": {\r\n        \"CLUSTER_ENDPOINT_URL\": \"https:\/\/server-2.ami.com\",\r\n        \"CLUSTER_BALANCER_URL\": \"https:\/\/server-2.ami.com\"\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"host\": \"server-3.ami.com\",\r\n      \"username\": \"ubuntu\",\r\n      \"pem\": \".\/ssh.pem\",\r\n      \"env\": {\r\n\"CLUSTER_ENDPOINT_URL\": \"https:\/\/server-3.ami.com\",\r\n        \"CLUSTER_BALANCER_URL\": \"https:\/\/server-3.ami.com\"\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"host\": \"server-4.ami.com\",\r\n      \"username\": \"ubuntu\",\r\n      \"pem\": \".\/ssh.pem\",\r\n      \"env\": {\r\n        \"CLUSTER_ENDPOINT_URL\": \"https:\/\/server-4.ami.com\",\r\n        \"CLUSTER_BALANCER_URL\": \"https:\/\/server-4.ami.com\"\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    }<\/pre>\n<li><strong>Adding MONGO_URL<\/strong><\/li>\n<p>MONGO_URL is one of environment variables in <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.meteor.com\/\">Meteor<\/a><\/strong>, which is used for connecting to Mongo in production environment. To add MONGO_URL, I run the following command:<\/p>\n<pre>{\r\n\u201cMONGO_URL\"        : \"mongodb:\/\/lumin:XXXXXX@54.174.9.184:27017, 54.174.9.185:27017, 54.174.9.186:27017, 54.174.9.187:27017\/Ami?replicaSet=Ami\"\r\n}<\/pre>\n<li><strong>Enable OPLOG<\/strong><\/li>\n<p>Oplog or operation log is a special collection that records all the write operations as they are applied to the database (you can find more helpful information at: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/meteor\/docs\/blob\/version-NEXT\/long-form\/oplog-observe-driver.md\">https:\/\/github.com\/meteor\/docs\/blob\/version-NEXT\/long-form\/oplog-observe-driver.md<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>The command used to enable Oplog is as followed:<\/p>\n<pre>{ MONGO_OPLOG_URL: \u2018mongodb:\/\/lumin:XXXXXX@54.174.9.184:27017, 54.174.9.185:27017, 54.174.9.186:27017, 54.174.9.187:27017\/ local?authSource=admin\r\n}<\/pre>\n<h4>Step 4: Deploy<\/h4>\n<p>Are you done all of these above steps? Let&#8217;s move to deploy our app. Firstly, I go to settings folder of the app.<\/p>\n<li><strong>Setup servers when using MUP for the first time<\/strong><\/li>\n<pre>> mup setup<\/pre>\n<li><strong>Bundle your project and deploy to servers<\/strong><\/li>\n<pre>> mup deploy<\/pre>\n<p>So far, I have deployed my app successful. MUP also support other useful commands to maintain your production app. After you&#8217;ve edited environmental variables of <code>settings.json<\/code>, you can reconfigure the app without deploying again:<\/p>\n<pre>> mup reconfig <\/pre>\n<p>Check out other useful commands:<\/p>\n<pre>> mup stop # stop all servers\r\n> mup start  # start all servers\r\n> mup restart  #  stop all running servers and start it again<\/pre>\n<p>Congratulation! Your Meteor app is now ready to dance to your tune. Keep an eye out for our further blog on Meteor tutorials and you will find out more helpful information. I would love to know whether you deploy your app successfully or not in the comments below.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/2016\/08\/02\/how-to-deploy-and-scale-your-meteor-apps\/","date":"2016-08-02T10:00:19","modified":"2016-08-15T11:16:59","format":"standard","slug":"how-to-deploy-and-scale-your-meteor-apps","guid":"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/?p=745","excerpt":"<p>FYI: This is one of two topics of our 2nd Meteor Meetup on July 9th, 2016.

In this blog, I am going to list some of essential stuff like this, including <strong>deployment environments<\/strong>, <strong>variables<\/strong>, <strong>domain name<\/strong>, <strong>SSL certificate<\/strong> and <strong>CDN<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h4>Deployment environments<\/h4>\n<p>Deployment environments in Meteor includes <strong>three server tiers<\/strong> that are <strong>Development<\/strong>, <strong>Staging<\/strong> and <strong>Production<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Development<\/em>: This is where you develop new features for the app and run local tests. If your app runs successfully with the code, it will move to the Staging.<\/li>\n<li><em>Staging<\/em>: This environment is made to resemble Production environment but invisible to users. Here, your application will be checked on all features as well as performance before being released.<\/li>\n<li><em>Production<\/em>: After your app goes through the test in Staging, it is officially deployed for users to interact directly with.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Deployment environments are explained in great detail at:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/guide.meteor.com\/deployment.html#environments\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/guide.meteor.com\/deployment.html#environments<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Deployment_environment\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Deployment_environment<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Environment variables and settings<\/h4>\n<p>Make sure environment variables and settings all are available for your deployment process.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Environment variables comprises a set of dynamic named values <strong>ENV_VARS<\/strong> such as <strong>MAIL_URL<\/strong>, <strong>MONGO_URL<\/strong>, <strong>ROOT_URL<\/strong> and <strong>NODE_OPTIONS<\/strong>. They can affect the way running process which is, in this case, Meteor. Without environment variables, settings could not be configured when running in production.\t<\/li>\n<p>One reliable destination for getting variables is <a href=\"https:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/process.html#process_process_env\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/process.html#process_process_env<\/a><\/p>\n<li>Settings help you store all the important information of your app in each environment and has the form of settings.json. You can create a <strong>settings.json<\/strong> file and run it by using the command line <strong><code>meteor run --settings settings.json.<\/code><\/strong>\n<p>or put it into the <strong>METEOR_SETTINGS<\/strong> environment variable. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Domain name, SSL Certificate and CDN<\/h4>\n<p>Remember to register a domain name for your site, so that users can access to your site. Then, it is absolutely necessary for you to generate an <strong>SSL<\/strong> (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate. <\/p>\n<p><strong>CDN<\/strong> (Content Delivery Network or Content Distribution Network), in spite of being optional, should be set for your site.

Meteor is now widely used by developers due to its enormous advantages. Nowadays, there are tons of web and mobile apps built with Meteor such as <strong>Telescope<\/strong>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.luminpdf.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Luminpdf.com<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crowdr.tv\/\" target=\"_blank\">Crowdr.tv<\/a>, and of course, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.meteor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Meteor.com<\/a>, which is the official website of <strong>Meteor Development Group<\/strong>. <\/p>\n<p>Renovated by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designveloper.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Designveloper<\/a> team, Meteor.com is a typical example of how Meteor works in practice. The website now has an eye-catching design with well-organized elements that highlight Meteor\u2019s products, services and other important information. <\/p>\n<h3>Single-page web application<\/h3>\n<p>A single-page application is known as a web application or a website that fits on a single web page.  It is developed with an aim of improving the user experience by delivering all the functionality for an application without taking time to reload the whole page.<br \/>\nAmong web browser JavaScript frameworks, including AngularJS, Ember.js and React, Meteor is the one designed exclusively for developing single-page applications. As a main part of its capacities, Meteor made it easier for us to create a single-page web app of Meteor.com. <\/p>\n<p>Now you are at Meteor home page and want to explore <strong>Developers tab<\/strong> and other tabs on menu bar. Then, with a single mouse click, you don\u2019t have to wait any longer for the content to display because it immediately appears without refreshing the page.<br \/>\nThis video illustrates the way it does actually.<br \/>\n<iframe class=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/UxKdi3Hpka8?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h4>How can Meteor do that?<\/h4>\n<p>As a client-server framework, Meteor ensures that all layers, from the database to the templates, update themselves whenever necessary. Using the <strong>Distributed Data Protocol<\/strong> (DDP) and a publish-subscribe pattern to automatically propagate data changes to clients without requiring the developer to write any synchronize code.<br \/>\nAlong with that, Meteor\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/guide.meteor.com\/blaze.html\" target=\"_blank\">Blaze<\/a>, which is a powerful reactive rendering library of Meteor, makes it easier to create live-updating or real-time user interfaces.<br \/>\nTo have a deeper understanding about this part, carefully read comprehensive guides at <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.meteor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/docs.meteor.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Fluid Responsive Web<\/h4>\n<p>Responsive web design allows you to use different devices to view a website, including desktop monitors, laptops, tablets and mobile phones without creating compatible versions for each of them. Meteor.com is designed based on the concept of the <strong>responsive web design<\/strong> method, specifically a fluid one which uses percentages of the total available width for the columns. You can find more about different types of responsive web design at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.profoundgrid.com\/\">http:\/\/www.profoundgrid.com<\/a>.<br \/>\nThanks to Meteor, the team created a brand new look for Meteor.com using CSS, which decides the layout of webpage, instead of building an isolated site and corresponding codebase for each device. Although Meteor (or MeteorJS) is not the only framework used for building responsive web app, it provides amazing responsive packages.<br \/>\nLet\u2019s see how it looks on such devices.<br \/>\n<div id=\"attachment_539\" style=\"width: 710px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/How-Meteor-works-1.png\" alt=\"Meteor for Meteor.com\" width=\"700\" height=\"500\" class=\"size-full wp-image-539\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Laptop\/Desktop<\/p><\/div><br \/>\n<div id=\"attachment_570\" style=\"width: 710px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/How-Meteor-works-2.jpg\" alt=\"How Meteor works on Meteor.com\" width=\"700\" height=\"601\" class=\"size-full wp-image-570\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tablet<\/p><\/div><br \/>\n<div id=\"attachment_541\" style=\"width: 710px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/How-Meteor-works-3.png\" alt=\"Meteor for Meteor.com\" width=\"700\" height=\"589\" class=\"size-full wp-image-541\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Content in 3 columns<\/p><\/div><br \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/How-Meteor-works-4.jpg\" alt=\"How Meteor works on Meteor.com\" width=\"700\" height=\"457\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-563\" \/><br \/>\nObviously, the interface of the web changes in different viewports, resulting in the rearrangement of page elements. Here you can see that the menu bar reshuffles to the right side of the page.  Elements in three and two columns now reshuffles to one column to fit with the size of devices. <\/p>\n<p>Experience yourself by taking a tour around <a href=\"https:\/\/www.meteor.com\" target=\"_blank\">Meteor.com<\/a>.<br \/>\nYou want to have such a single-page and responsive web as Meteor.com, don\u2019t you? If yes, take your first steps right away.

Unlike other frameworks, Meteor is a smart and powerful tool that allows you build web and mobile applications with one single language of <strong>JavaScript<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of programming, Meteor is described as an <strong>open-source and full-stack JavaScript platform<\/strong> that includes a key set of technologies for building reactive web and mobile applications. Meteor requires less code, so even though you are newbies to programming, you are able to build your own amazing app in a very short time. Sound great!<\/p>\n<h3>Why should you choose Meteor?<\/h3>\n<p>You may have heard or read a number of articles that are all about Meteor. Some people even call Meteor a magic. You also had a look around its benefits in our previous blog <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/2016\/06\/11\/get-started-with-meteor\/\" target=\"_blank\">Get Started With Meteor<\/a>. Now, let me go in details of reasons for choosing Meteor for your future projects according to both programming gurus and beginners in this blog.<\/p>\n<h4>Easy to learn and simple to work<\/h4>\n<p>From the perspective of a newbie, I must say that Meteor is the easiest framework to use that I have ever known. Using Meteor, you are not required to know much about complicated stuff relating to programming. Instead, with a solid background of JavaScript and a basic understanding of things such as HTML, CSS, and MongoDB, you can build and run a modern app following a decent structure provided by Meteor.<br \/>\nMy point is that whether you are new to programming, a semi-experienced developer or not full-fledged ones, you will find it surprisingly easy to work with Meteor indeed.<\/p>\n<h4>Full-stack reactivity<\/h4>\n<p>Meteor is a full package of different technology components that work together to get your app run smoothly such as:<br \/>\n&#8211; The front-end rendering library (Blaze, React and Angular) for making raw data and logic understandable to browsers;<br \/>\n&#8211; DDP (distributed data protocol) for connecting non-Meteor apps to Meteor servers or non-Meteor servers;<br \/>\n&#8211; Livequery for transforming Mongo into a real-time database<br \/>\n&#8211; Microservices \u2013 an architectural pattern for breaking your app up into modules that run as separate services. They communicate by API\u2019s or in Meteor using service discovery and the above-mentioned component of DDP.<br \/>\n&#8211; Meteor\u2019s current main database &#8211; MongoDB<br \/>\n<div id=\"attachment_384\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-384\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Meteor-components.png\" alt=\"Meteor's architecture\" width=\"600\" height=\"360\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Meteor&#8217;s architecture<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<h4>Real-time application<\/h4>\n<p>By using <strong>DDP <\/strong>(Distributed Data Protocol), Meteor makes it possible for you to see any changes made on every open page of the app without a browser refresh. For example, if you highlight a word of an online PDF document with yellow, then every open browser will show this highlighted word without refreshing them.<\/p>\n<h4>JavaScript &#8211; One language solves all<\/h4>\n<p>How do you build and manage the front-end, the back-end and the database? Is it possible to develop an app with one single language?\u00a0 Of course, it definitely is. Meteor enables you to develop an awesome app just by using JavaScript &#8211; one of the most popular programming languages in the world &#8211; in all environments that are application server, web browser, and mobile devices.<\/p>\n<p>One language with one line of code can run on both the client and the server, as well as do different things in either environment. How amazing it is!<\/p>\n<h3>Where to learn Meteor?<\/h3>\n<p>For ultimate guides on what Meteor is and how to use Meteor for mobile and app development, you can visit:<br \/>\n&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/guide.meteor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/guide.meteor.com<\/a><br \/>\n&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.meteor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/docs.meteor.com<\/a><br \/>\nInformative tutorials are available at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meteor.com\/tutorials\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.meteor.com\/tutorials<\/a>. Here, you will get step-by-step instructions to build an app with Meteor from beginner to advanced level.<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>Whether you are experienced coders or basically a shop owner who has an interest in programming, you can easily learn and work on your Meteor project with minimal development effort in a short period of time.<\/p>\n<p>If you are about to develop a fantastic web or mobile application yourself, embark on working with Meteor right away. And if you don\u2019t know what your app will look like, what do you think if I will show you an example of an app developed using Meteor in my next blog?

So at first, as a team leader and core maker, I spent quite a lot of time to find a good starting point, I meant stuff like how to structure the project, which frontend stack to use, how that stack connects to server, how to set up and bring all those things together, etc, to satisfy all the project\u2019s requirements.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, I settled down with <strong>Meteor<\/strong> for backend, <strong>React<\/strong> for frontend, and <strong>Vanilajs ES6 MVC<\/strong> for the app extension (this was the most interesting part of the project. I will talk about it in another blog). At first things went well and smooth. Needless to say that React was so amazing that I completely changed my thoughts when programming.<\/p>\n<p>But soon later, since this was the first time I had really built such a big project with React, things started to get messy. I encountered a problem that every big project coded in React had. Hence, I have this post written to let you know what problem was and how I attempted to solve it.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites<\/h3>\n<p>React is introduced to be simple and very easy to learn for beginners. That is definitely true, but frankly speaking, it takes quite an effort to come up with when you are at beginner level.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this post is not aimed for beginners because I am writing about experience I learned in a big project, not just the way to use React for Meteor project. So it may require readers to have the following knowledge to understand what I am going to write:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/goo.gl\/xxGHnu\">React container component<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/redux.js.org\/docs\/basics\/DataFlow.html\">React unidirectional data flow<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/mDj9fO\">React Mixins<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/goo.gl\/V5v271\">React in Meteor 1.2<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/x2Sblm\">Ramdajs<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 id=\"the-problem-that-i-encountered\">The problem that I encountered<\/h3>\n<p>I can summary the problem with only one word, and that is <strong>maintainable<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Follow the unidirectional data flow principle, I created a container component for each routes for the problem. This component is in charge of almost every logic stuff for the route it is being used for. E.g. it takes care of subscribe data\/call methods from Meteor server, is a middle man for its children components talking to one another. With all those missions, soon it becomes a very big and fat guy.<\/p>\n<p>The file in which I coded the container component in was about 700 lines when I just finished about half of the work. This was clearly unacceptable. If I had ignored this problem and kept coding to get the job done fast, it would have been a nightmare for maintainer\/debugger.<\/p>\n<p>Knowing that this was my company\u2019s main project, meaning that my colleagues and I would be working on it for years, I stopped coding features and started reviewing the code.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"first-attempt\">First attempt<\/h3>\n<p>I looked at all the container\u2019s functions and realized that they could be categorized into four groups:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Component&#8217;s must-have functions: getInitialState, getMeteorData, render, etc\u2026<\/li>\n<li>Handler functions: all event handlers for all container\u2019s children components<\/li>\n<li>Helper functions: functions to help get necessary data for container\u2019s children components based on container props and state. There functions are merely pure functions, they take input and produce output without touching the container state or talking to Meteor server.<\/li>\n<li>Logic functions: functions to modify the component state, call methods from server. These functions are called by event handlers in response to user actions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With this model in mind, I decoupled the last three groups\u2019 functions into three separate files and imported them back in the container through mixins.<\/p>\n<p>The directory of the container looked like this:<\/p>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root\r\n|   ...\r\n|---...\r\n|---poppi:client-container-example-component\r\n    |---client\r\n        |---components\r\n            |---subcomponent1\r\n                |   ...\r\n            |---subcomponent2\r\n                |   ...\r\n            |   ContainerExample.jsx\r\n            |   ContainerExampleContainer.jsx\r\n            |   ContainerExampleHandlers.js\r\n            |   ContainerExampleHelpers.js\r\n            |   ContainerExampleLogicFuncs.js\r\n    |   package.js\r\n|---...\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<p>And also the code of the container<\/p>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>ContainerExampleContainer = React.createClass({\r\n  mixins: [\r\n    ReactMeteorData,\r\n    ContainerExampleHandlers,\r\n    ContainerExampleHelpers,\r\n    ContainerExampleLogicFuncs,\r\n  ],\r\n  getInitialState() {\r\n    ...\r\n  },\r\n  getMeteorData() {\r\n    ...\r\n  },\r\n  render() {\r\n    ...\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<p>My container looked much better. It became a thinner and more handsome guy. When you need to find a function, I recommend this decoupling technique for a faster and more semantic solution. However, it would be even better if I did not face a hurdle <\/p>\n<h3 id=\"push-it-a-bit-further\">Push it a bit further<\/h3>\n<p>Even though I separated all functions into 3 different mixin files, I had not had any idea on where to put each function yet. All the time I had to check those 3 functions to identify the appropriate function places. This was time-consuming and I needed a more efficient way. The only way that I thought of at that time was looking at the function calling statement.<\/p>\n<p>After thinking for a while, I fell back to the basic technique widely in js: \u201cnamespace\u201d. I grouped all the functions under a namespace obj inside the mixin obj. My three mixin file then became:<\/p>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>\/\/ ContainerExampleHandlers.js\r\nContainerExampleHandlers = {\r\n  Ha: {\r\n    clickHandler() {\r\n      this.L.test1();\r\n      return;\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n\r\n\/\/ ContainerExampleHelpers.js\r\nContainerExampleHelpers = {\r\n  He: {\r\n    getData(state) {\r\n      return {\r\n        state\r\n      };\r\n    },\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\n\/\/ ContainerExampleLogicFuncs.js\r\nContainerExampleLogicFuncs = {\r\n  L: {\r\n    test1(param1) {\r\n      const data = this.He.getData(param1);\r\n      this.setState({\r\n        ...data,\r\n      });\r\n    },\r\n    test2(param2) {\r\n      Meteor.call('test2', param2);\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<p>By just looking at the calling function statement, I knew exactly where these functions came from. This is extremely useful and efficient when working on a big and complicated project.<\/p>\n<p>But unfortunately I still could not enjoy the fantasy of this technique, because the scope inside all functions was wrong.<\/p>\n<p>So I had to bind their contexts to the right ones.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"ramda-to-the-rescue\">Ramda to the rescue<\/h3>\n<p>The binding process could be done easily by a for-in loop inside the <strong>getInitialState<\/strong> function of the container. But it required more than that and I needed a more unified, modern, handy and understandable way, also shorter one to use in this big project. Luckily, the rise of <strong>Ramda<\/strong> recently got my attention and turned out to be the best fit for my requirements.<\/p>\n<p>Finally I came up with this binding function:<\/p>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>\/\/ bindMixinFunctions.js\r\nbindMixinFunctions = R.converge(function(keys, values, ctx) {\r\n  const bindValues = R.map((val) =&gt; R.bind(val, ctx), values);\r\n  return R.zipObj(keys, bindValues);\r\n}, [\r\n  R.flip(R.keys),\r\n  R.flip(R.values),\r\n  R.identity\r\n]);\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<p>And use it in action:<\/p>\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>ContainerExampleContainer = React.createClass({\r\n  mixins: [\r\n    ReactMeteorData,\r\n    ContainerExampleHandlers,\r\n    ContainerExampleLogicFuncs,\r\n    ContainerExampleHelpers,\r\n  ],\r\n  getInitialState() {\r\n    const thisBindMixinFunctions = bindMixinFunctions(this);\r\n\r\n    this.He = thisBindMixinFunctions(this.He);\r\n    this.Ha = thisBindMixinFunctions(this.Ha);\r\n    this.L = thisBindMixinFunctions(this.L);\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n  },\r\n  ...\r\n});\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<p>After all the hard work, I was able the enjoy the result. The code ran smoothly as expected and was much better in term of structuring, semantic and maintainable criteria. I did not have to worry about later maintaining\/debugging process any more.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>It may be a bit tedious to write all this code and structuring before implementing the real features. But for me it is really worthy, this pattern actually saves me a lot of time and effort trying to figure out where a function is, what it does, how it connects to others functions.<\/p>\n<p>If you are still using React version 0.14.3 in Meteor 1.2, which is possible if you already worked in these frameworks, I hope that you will get benefited from my pattern and take the best of it.<\/p>\n<p>If you are going to set up a new project with the latest version of React and Meteor and decide to implement this pattern, I would love to hear how you do that.<\/p>\n","parent":null,"link":"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/2016\/06\/21\/react-structure-container-component-in-meteor\/","date":"2016-06-21T09:49:34","modified":"2016-06-30T11:34:24","format":"standard","slug":"react-structure-container-component-in-meteor","guid":"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/?p=208","excerpt":"<p>FYI: This is one of three topics of our first Meteor Meetup on June 4th, 2016.

Follow these steps and you&#8217;ll finish it in just 30 minutes!<!--more--><\/p>\n<h4>Where do I begin?<\/h4>\n<p><strong>To create a Meteor app<\/strong>, simply open your terminal and run this command:<\/p>\n<pre> meteor create simple-chat<\/pre>\n<p>Now try to run your first Meteor app:<\/p>\n<pre>cd simple-chat\r\nmeteor<\/pre>\n<p>Let&#8217;s check it out using your web browser: <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:3000\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/localhost:3000\/<\/a><\/p>\n<h4>You&#8217;ve told that it&#8217;s all JavaScript, why does it look so strange?<\/h4>\n<p>Every new Meteor app includes <strong>Blaze<\/strong>, which is Meteor\u2019s built-in reactive rendering library. Usually, templates are written in <strong>Spacebars<\/strong>. These templates are compiled into JavaScript UI components that are rendered by the Blaze library. I&#8217;ll continue to explain it later \ud83d\ude00<\/p>\n<p>Now add some folders like this:<br \/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-54\" style=\"border: 1px;\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/files2.png\" alt=\"files2\" width=\"150\" height=\"280\" \/><br \/>\nThis is the file structure that Meteor recommends us. You can find out more <a href=\"http:\/\/guide.meteor.com\/structure.html#javascript-structure\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<br \/>\nNext, open <strong>client\/main.html<\/strong>, replace all the code with this:<\/p>\n<pre>&lt;head&gt;\r\n  &lt;title&gt;My Simple Chat&lt;\/title&gt;\r\n    &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1\"&gt;\r\n&lt;\/head&gt;<\/pre>\n<p>We will write the body code in a new file. Let&#8217;s add some files to the <strong>imports\/ui<\/strong> directory:<br \/>\n<strong>body.html<\/strong><\/p>\n<pre>&lt;body&gt;\r\n  &lt;h3&gt;SIMPLE METEOR CHAT&lt;\/h3&gt;\r\n   &lt;ul&gt;\r\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{{#each messages}}\r\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{{&gt; message}}\r\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{{\/each}}\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;\/body&gt;\r\n&lt;template name=\"message\"&gt;\r\n \u00a0&lt;li&gt;{{text}}&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/template&gt;<\/pre>\n<p>and <strong>body.js<\/strong><\/p>\n<pre>import { Template } from 'meteor\/templating';\r\nimport '.\/body.html';\r\nTemplate.body.helpers({\r\n \u00a0messages: [\r\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{ text: 'Hello,' },\r\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{ text: 'Nice to meet you!' },\r\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{ text: '&lt;3' },\r\n \u00a0],\r\n});\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Also open file <strong>imports\/ui\/body.js<\/strong> and replace all the codes with this:<\/p>\n<pre> import '..\/imports\/ui\/body.js';<\/pre>\n<p>Then you will see something like this:<br \/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-57\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/hello.png\" alt=\"hello\" width=\"200\" height=\"230\" \/><br \/>\nYou can see that Meteor renders the HTML with head section from <code>&lt;head&gt;<\/code> tag in<strong> main.html<\/strong>, body section from <code>&lt;body&gt;<\/code> tag in <strong>body.html<\/strong>. Look at the body, you will see this:<\/p>\n<pre> {{#each messages}}\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{{&gt; message}}\r\n {{\/each}}<\/pre>\n<p>This is <strong>Spacebar<\/strong> syntax. Like I&#8217;ve explained before, Spacebar is a Meteor template language. It uses statements surrounded by double curly braces such as <code>{{#each}}<\/code> and <code>{{#if}}<\/code> to let you add logic and data to your views. <em>(You can read more about <a href=\"http:\/\/guide.meteor.com\/blaze.html\" target=\"_blank\">Blaze<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/meteorcapture.com\/spacebars\/\" target=\"_blank\">Spacebar<\/a>)<\/em>.<br \/>\nSo in the code above, each item from the messages collection will be put into template named <strong>message<\/strong>. Template in Meteor is just like Partial view in ASP.NET, it&#8217;s a chunk of HTML that can be safely inserted into an existing DOM. You can define it using this:<\/p>\n<pre> &lt;template name=\"templateName\"&gt;\r\n #put template code here\r\n &lt;\/template&gt;<\/pre>\n<p>and reference in your JavaScript with <code>Template.templateName<\/code>. Furthermore, in your JavaScript, the body section can be referenced with <code>Template.body<\/code>. It&#8217;s a special &#8220;parent&#8221; template including the other child templates.<br \/>\nNow we have 3 messages, created by the <code>Template.body.helpers<\/code> in the body.js. So how can we can type message, send it and show in our app? We will figure out how to do it later.<\/p>\n<h4>Can we style it?<\/h4>\n<p>The easiest way is using <strong>Bootstrap<\/strong>. With Meteor, adding Bootstrap can be done in the blink of an eye. Open another terminal tab, go to the <strong>simple-chat<\/strong> directory and run this:<\/p>\n<pre> meteor add twbs:bootstrap<\/pre>\n<p>Done! Now we can use Bootstrap. Replace your <strong>body.html<\/strong> code with this:<\/p>\n<pre> &lt;body&gt;\r\n  \u00a0&lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;div class=\"row\"&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;h3 class=\"text-center\" &gt;SIMPLE METEOR CHAT&lt;\/h3&gt;\r\n \t   \t&lt;!-- text holder --&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;div class=\"col-md-12\"&gt;\r\n \t\t&lt;!-- login button --&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;div class=\"panel panel-info\"&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;div class=\"panel-heading\"&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GROUP CHAT\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;div class=\"panel-body\"&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;ul class=\"media-list\"&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;!-- message template --&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{{#each messages}}\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{{&gt; message}}\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{{\/each}}\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;!-- message textbox --&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;form class=\"new-message\"&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;div class=\"panel-footer\"&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;div class=\"input-group\"&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" placeholder=\"Enter Message\" \/&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;span class=\"input-group-btn\"&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;button class=\"btn btn-info send\" type=\"submit\"&gt;SEND&lt;\/button&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;\/span&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;\/form&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n  \u00a0&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n &lt;\/body&gt;<\/pre>\n<p>Then we will create several files in the <strong>imports\/ui\/<\/strong> directory to separate each template to a different html file and js file.<br \/>\nCreate new file <strong>message.html<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<pre> &lt;template name=\"message\"&gt;\r\n  \u00a0&lt;li class=\"media\"&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;div class=\"media-body\"&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;div class=\"media\"&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;a class=\"pull-left\" href=\"#\"&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;img class=\"media-object img-circle img-responsive\" src=\"http:\/\/lorempixel.com\/60\/60\/people\/\" \/&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;div class=\"media-body\" &gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{{text}}\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n  \u00a0&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n &lt;\/template&gt;\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Create new file <strong>message.js<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<pre> import { Template } from 'meteor\/templating';\r\n import '.\/message.html';\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Open <strong>body.js<\/strong> and add this after <code>import '.\/body.html'<\/code>:<\/p>\n<pre> import '.\/message.js';<\/pre>\n<p>Thank to Bootstrap we have such an elegant app:<br \/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-51\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/bootstrap.png\" alt=\"bootstrap\" width=\"550\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Nice, but it doesn&#8217;t work, I can&#8217;t send message!

In this demo, to make it easy, assume that the entire database is present on the client.<\/p>\n<p>We also import the <strong>messages.js<\/strong> to the server. Open the <strong>server\/main.js<\/strong> and add this to the second line:<\/p>\n<pre> import '..\/imports\/api\/messages.js';<\/pre>\n<p>Now we can display message from the collection by opening <strong>body.js<\/strong> and replacing the <code>Template.body.helpers<\/code> with this:<\/p>\n<pre> import { Messages } from '..\/api\/messages.js';\r\n Template.body.helpers({\r\n  \u00a0tasks() {\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0return Tasks.find();\r\n  \u00a0},\r\n });\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry when your chat group is empty. Just a few steps left then you will receive your messages. \ud83d\ude00<br \/>\nAs we created the message textbox in the <strong>body.html<\/strong> in the previous step, now we will handle the submit event to insert new message.

is Meteor?<\/h3>\n<p>You&#8217;ve heard people talk about <strong>Meteor<\/strong> recently. So here are a few things you should know about Meteor. Be careful when reading this because you will fall in love with it immediately:<!--more--><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Meteor is written using <strong>NodeJs<\/strong>. You only have to write JavaScript and it will run on both client-side and server-side.<\/li>\n<li>Meteor produces <strong>cross-platform code<\/strong>. Write once, run anywhere, from desktop to mobile platforms.<\/li>\n<li>With Meteor, your application is real-time by default. It integrates with <strong>MongoDB<\/strong> and uses the <strong>Distributed Data Protocol<\/strong> and a publish\u2013subscribe pattern to automatically propagate data changes to clients.<\/li>\n<li>You can save a lot of time with smart packages. Packages are handled through Meteor\u2019s package management site: <a title=\"undefined\" href=\"https:\/\/atmospherejs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">AtmosphereJs<\/a><\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s optimized for developer happiness. Beginning developers can quickly build something impressive, while advanced developers can appreciate Meteor\u2019s flexibility.<\/li>\n<li>The community is extremely supportive.They organizes meetups, publishes free training materials, and offers help wherever possible.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Very cool, right?

Meteor is amongst of those smart tools. So why don&#8217;t we start using Meteor right now? \ud83d\ude00<\/p>\n<h3>How to install Meteor?<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s totally simple!<\/p>\n<h5>OSX \/ LINUX<\/h5>\n<p>Install the latest official Meteor release from your terminal:<\/p>\n<pre>curl https:\/\/install.meteor.com\/ | sh<\/pre>\n<h5>WINDOWS<\/h5>\n<p>Simply download and run the official Meteor installer: <a href=\"https:\/\/install.meteor.com\/windows\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/install.meteor.com\/windows<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Your first Meteor app<\/h3>\n<p>To create a Meteor app, simply open your terminal and run this command:<\/p>\n<pre> meteor create hello-world<\/pre>\n<p>Then you will see a folder named <strong>hello-world<\/strong> and several files have just been created:<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-55\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/hello-world-1.png\" alt=\"files-default\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Take a look at these files:<\/p>\n<pre>client\/main.js \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0# a JavaScript entry point loaded on the client\r\nclient\/main.html \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0# an HTML file that defines view templates\r\nclient\/main.css \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0# a CSS file to define your app's styles\r\nserver\/main.js \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0# a JavaScript entry point loaded on the server\r\npackage.json \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0# a control file for installing NPM packages\r\n.meteor \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0# internal Meteor files\r\n.gitignore \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0# a control file for git\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Now try to run your first Meteor app:<\/p>\n<pre>cd hello-world\r\nmeteor<\/pre>\n<p>Let&#8217;s check it out using your web browser: <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:3000\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/localhost:3000\/<\/a><br \/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-61\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.designveloper.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/welcome.png\" alt=\"welcome\" width=\"250\" height=\"280\" \/><br \/>\nYou can play around with the demo app. Open your favorite editor (like Atom, Sublime Text, WebStorm&#8230;) and try editing the file <strong>client\/main.html<\/strong>, then you will see your web page change immediately without refreshing! This is called <strong>hot code push<\/strong>, since Meteor uses data on the wire: the server sends data, not HTML, and the client renders it. I can&#8217;t tell you how much I love it, because before Meteor, I only study ASP.NET MVC and Java J2EE at school. Whenever I change the code on server side, I have to stop the app, edit, then restart it. It takes a lot of my time since my computer&#8217;s performance is quite bad.
